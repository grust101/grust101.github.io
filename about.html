Tory Rust is a New York based fashion photographer with a unique style that infuses color and graphic elements. Identifying her interest at a young age, she later developed a platform for her vision in the fashion world.

Raised in Fargo, ND, attending graduate school at The School of Visual Arts brought her to the nation’s fashion capital. Last spring she achieved a master’s degree in fashion photography from the institution and began freelancing full-time.

Rust is passionate about her work and believes in taking pictures so she doesn’t have to deal with words. She’s been published in various magazines like NYLON and worked with major fashion companies including Barneys. Characterizing herself as a communicator over an artist, Rust hopes her visuals translate her vision and thoughts to fans and viewers.
