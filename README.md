# About grust101
I’m [Georgia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgia-rust/) or [grust101](https://github.com/grust101), a Solutions Engineer at GitHub. I am a vivacious learner :books: obsessed with effective communication :calling: and clean design :art:. I get up and go to work excited to guide GitHub's customers through architecture and implementation processes and ensure that GitHub is implemented and customized to fit each customer's needs and requirements.:raised_hands:

I first learned about GitHub and the open-source community while attending Dev Bootcamp, a 19-week intensive training program for web developers. Since then, I have become very passionate about mentoring “non-tech savvy” girls :girl::girl::girl: in STEM so they can feel empowered to become our future technology leaders.:sparkles: I try my best to support technology nonprofits such as Girls Who Code and Thorn. These initiatives and other open-source projects are what make me believe in the power of sharing ideas and code on GitHub and excited to come to work!

In my spare time, you can find me practicing throwing on a ceramics wheel:sake:, making sushi at home:sushi:, or you can’t find me because I am off traveling somewhere new! :airplane::palm_tree:
